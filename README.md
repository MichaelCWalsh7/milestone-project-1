*   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - The two main colours used are a burgundyish red and a dark matte grey. The intention was to have a mixture of 
        a modern and a more romantic aesthetic; with the matte grey and burgundy representing those two ideas respectively. 
        - There is also a cream-white colour in use as it provides a nice contrast with the burgundy red. 
        - The navbar hover colours are a range of different colours designed to visaully stand out to the user and make the individual sections
        more memorable.

    -   #### Typography
        - The two main fonts in use throughout the website are Shippori Mincho, and Montserrat, with Sans Serif as the fallback font for 
        both in case for any reason the fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly.
        - Shippori Mincho is a font based on The Tokyo Tsukiji Type Foundry No. 5 Mincho style. A common font in Japanese and Chinese
        typography, it has a much  more traditional look and feel than it's counterpart, Montserrat. This style is designed with the 
        intention of being used for long-form text setting in novels. As the website contains several instances of long-form dramatic prose, 
        including: two sample chapters from a book and a multi-stanza poem, it is both attractive and appropriate.
        - Montserrat, on the other hand has a more modern feel and is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive
        and appropriate.
        - The basic idea of having a mixture of two fonts used primarily throughout the website was to further compliment the idea of 
        blending modern and romantic aesthetics, with Shippori Mincho of course representing romantic and Montserrat of course representing
        the modern.
        - There is also a third font that is present in the footer & header nametag home button areas. This font is Parisienne, with a 
        fallback of cursive in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. This font was used primarily
        as a way to extend the idea of having aspects of romantic and modern aesthetics on the website. 

    -   #### Imagery
        - Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. I feel this 
        is well achieved by the close-up, high resolution nature of the image, and it's natural lighting. The hero image is also dual purpose,
        in that it has a kind of informative function; with first time users able to imply many things about the creator, with even just a cursory 
        glance at the image. For example, things like: age, gender, ethnicity etc.
        - Other images on the Home page, include icons in the 'Currently' section that represent the various different modules and programming
        languages that I will have been picking up from my progress with the Code Institute. These images offer an appealing variation in
        aesthetic and colour. But, also have an informative aspect to them by quickly and easily indicating to the user, what skills and 
        programming languages the creator is currently able to use, or will be able to use in the near future. Important information for 
        a prospective employer or a prospective colleague.
        - Other images in use are the company logos in the Work History section. These images provide a nice visual contrast and also a 
        more pleasant and better spaced format to the section. As the section contains a lot of text, the images are used to break up the 
        text, in such a way that clearly indicates to first time and frequent users alike, when one part of the Work History section has 
        begun, and another one has ended. They also serve an informative purpose for those users of the site who may recognise, or be 
        familiar with some of the aforementioned companies. This, of course, works better for some companies than for others. For instance: 
        One of the first companies mentioned, [Phoenix Architectural Salvage Ltd.](http://www.phoenixsalvage.ie/) is a small, niche company with 
        a fairly generic company logo, making it unlikely to be recognised by users. Other companies however, such as 
        [Supermacs](https://supermacs.ie/) or [English First](https://www.englishfirst.com/), are large-scale, multi-national corporations, 
        that prospective employers may recognise from thier logos alone. 
        - The Projects section of the website also has a plethora of images in use. However, it is important to note that these images are presented
        a bit differently to the user accross different devices. On smaller devices, the Projects images show up much like those in the Work history
        section. Image placement options on smaller devices are very limited, so they essentially appear  as expected. On larger screens though, the images
        expand. While the Work History images stayed small and to the left on larger screens, the Projects images do not. This is because the Projects 
        are more than simply just chapters in the creator's career, they repsresent the creator's creatitivty and ability, and thus warrant a more 
        distintive and striking position on screen.
