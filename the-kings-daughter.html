            <h1> Chapter 2 - The King's Daughter</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="project-text-content">
            <p>Sunlight broke softly through the veiled curtains of her 4-poster bed gently the rays of sun crept up
                to
                awaken her. Fiona von Ornstein rose slowly and sleepily at first, but then pulled back her rich
                Haissani
                velvet duvet and hopped out of bed to sample some of the fresh spring air that was wafting through
                her
                window. Fiona's quarters were a dozen stories high, on the second highest floor of the imposing
                Royal
                Tower, as befit a princess of her stature. She had a breath-taking view over the great white-stoned
                castle of Pinnetia (where the capital city she resided in took it's name from) and an even better
                view
                of the gardens of Aladeen, a great field of trees, ponds fountains, flowerbeds and even houses made
                of
                glass to allow flora to grow more easily in the winter months. Right now, the vast garden was mainly
                shades of deep blues and strong greens, from the winterberries, snap daisies and evergreen trees
                respectively. But spring had been quick to arrive and soon the garden would turn into a miles-long
                rainbow of daisies, roses, fruit and all manner of other botanical produce.
                Fiona drank in the view, closed her eyes and sighed happily. Shye was so excited for spring, soon
                she'd
                be able to ride on horseback around the castle grounds with her brother and father, swim in the warm
                pools with her mother and practice fencing and weaving outside with their butler Allan on a mild
                spring's evening. The thoughts of her family reminded her all of a sudden; today's the day! she
                thought,
                Father returns today! She could barely contain her excitement. Her father Thaddius had ruled
                strongly
                over their great south-eastern kingdom of Saerennia for years, and never once failed to bring his
                only
                daughter back a gift from his travels, even if he went to war as he had this time, to quarrel and
                treat
                with rebel lords in the north-western territory of Fantora. Fiona called upon her servants to fetch
                her
                pails of hot water to bathe in and a vial of lemon-and-lavender water to scent it.
                She did not have the whole floor to herself, only half of the fourteen or so large rooms on her
                floor of
                the Royal Tower made up her quarters, the other half belonged to her older brother Edwin, with her
                mother and father one floor up on the tower's highest floor. Many of the rooms were connected by a
                large
                antechamber in the centre of the tower that housed a spiralling, marble staircase that ran through
                all
                12 stories of the tower. The stairs coiled around a long, smooth, brass pole that also shot up all
                the
                way through the tower, which one could slide down in case of an emergency, or even just a general
                loathing of stairs.
                But before she left, she must dress. She pranced around her room gleefully, full of excitement. The
                room
                itself was extravagantly decorated with romantic paintings, large wardrobes and drawers aplenty to
                hold
                an innumerous quantity of jewels and clothes, with hanging pot-plants and vases of flowers anywhere
                else
                the room threatened to grow too vacuous. She dressed herself in a short white half-gown that went
                down
                to her waist, some sandals and a pair of flowing navy pants. She considered wearing a full gown or
                dress
                to replace the pants, but now that she was a woman and had 19 years she was a little more cautious
                of
                keeping her dignity when she swung down the brass pole all the way to the dining hall. She also
                brushed
                her long auburn hair so that it cadenced artfully in waves around her shoulders. She took a good
                look at
                herself in the mirror before heading down. A fair heart-shaped face stared back at her, her skin was
                pale-bronze, compliments of her father's pale skin and her mother's darker tone. But of all Fiona's
                features, her most striking was her eyes, She and Edwin had both inherited their father's thick
                auburn
                hair (though his had now turned grey) but only Edwin had his dark grey eyes. Fiona got her eyes from
                mother; a bright blood-red.
                She whirled down the brass pole in the staircase crying out her brother's name "Edwin! Eddieeee!"
                Edwin
                was already in the dining as she knew he would be. He'd become quite the early riser these days,
                though
                he had never been before, but now that he had 23 years, he was often trying to demonstrate that he
                was a
                man truly now, mature and responsible, just like his father. Fiona often teased him about it, but a
                bit
                less so recently. She'd seen her brother become even more anxious as of late and was starting to
                feel
                bad for him. The prince wasn't as blessed with looks as Fiona had been. The prince had inherited
                more
                from their father than their mother, he was tall, with long dark auburn hair, and a thin face,
                punctuated by a long hook nose and small dark grey eyes.
                "Morning!" she chimed when she saw him and planted a big kiss on his cheek. All she got in return
                was a
                low sleepy groan, Edwin had stayed up late these last few nights pouring over battle reports from
                the
                skirmishes with the rebel lords of Fantora in the north-west.
                Alestair de Fantora had slain his older brother, the baron Theodore de Fantora and taken his young
                brother Casper, along with Fiona's cousin Jason hostage, declaring Fantora an independent republic
                with
                him at the helm. Fiona had hardly ever seen Thaddius so wroth as he had been when he heard the news.
                "THE FOOL!!" He'd bellowed slamming the dining table with his big fist so hard that he had shattered
                a
                considerable portion of it to bits with just a single blow.
                "How could he think that this would end in anything other than slaughter!?" Edwin barely made it
                halfway
                through his request to join their father in the ride north when he had been cut short and refused
                with
                fury by their father. Fiona had though perhaps Edwin might argue as he usually did, but his father's
                tone had been dark and dangerous, brooking no argument. Thaddius had called forth his nearest and
                most
                trusted vassals, wardens and commanders, even going so far as to mobilize the Triumvirate, a group
                of 3
                of the wisest and most trusted leaders in the country, who represented the tier of governance just
                under
                the king. He had ridden forth with his steward Fidel Allaire, and 1,000 of his own personal guard,
                arguably the most elite and certainly the most feared of Searennian military, the Lightning Spears.
                Miles on, further north, he had been joined by a large force of 50,000 spear and 35,000 horse, and
                further still the Haderan legion had joined them. 5,000 strong, spears, swords, fire-slingers,
                archers
                and other invokers and weavers of all kinds, all mounted on bercers, huge savage dogs large enough
                for a
                man (or even two) to ride. They had made short work of the hundreds of miles separating Pinnetia and
                Fantora, especially considering the massive size of the army. Five weeks on, the king was set to
                return
                to his castle.
                But Edwin had stayed behind as castellan, and sat at the head of the table where his father had been
                when they'd all first heard the news, though they'd had to replace the ruined table since. Fiona sat
                down next to him as servants laid out breakfast before her.
                "What news north Edwin?" She asked gently.
                "Hmm haven't I told you that you should be reading these battle reports with me? You're a princess
                of a
                kingdom, you shouldn't have to depend on your big brother to tell you everything."
                "I don't! But some of us actually enjoy a good night's sleep, you know. And come on, it's a war,
                anything could happen, of course I'm worried..."
                "If you were truly worried about father you'd be as well-informed as I am."
                That hurt her, Fiona had always been prickly about her pride and hated to be seen as dithering
                spoilt
                brat. "Eddie," she said hurt, "Do you really think me so self-absorbed?"
                Her brother sighed and relented. "No, no of course not." He said dryly. "how much do you know so far
                then Oni?" Fiona had begun to grow weary of that nickname but it let it slide as she was eager to
                hear
                the news.
                "Well in truth I thought the whole affair was done and dusted a couple of weeks ago when you told me
                father had agreed to suspend the siege of Fantora in return for Alestair agreeing to release his
                hostages and attend a council with the Triumvirate to treat with father... But he's been slow to
                return
                and more reports have come back than I thought would... What happened? Did alestair break his word?"
                "No, not yet anyway the bloody snake, but he's as ambitious as he is deceitful" said Edwin, the
                mornings
                tiredness giving way to disgust as he spoke of the rebel lord. "There was trouble on the way back
                that
                halted them, they strayed a bit too close to the Variasa Forest on their way back it would seem..."
                Fiona knew that could only mean one thing "... Dark Blades." She realized morbidly. "God, Edwin why
                the
                hell didn't you tell me earlier!?"
                "These reports have been here a week Fiona, I'm not your bloody messenger."
                Fiona's worry helped her swallow down her anger at that comment.
                "Surely they would never face father's full strength in the field?" she asked.
                "No, those brigands wouldn't dare, but they harried his rearguard as they made camp, and slew 500
                men
                without taking a single loss."
                "500!? How many men is father bringing back south?"
                "He left with 3 times that number, more or less. But now his party is merely a thousand..."
                The Dark blades were an ancient order who had held the colossal Variasa Forest for a thousand years,
                or
                thrice that depending on what scholars were asked. Despite their names Dark Blades were known for
                their
                prowess with bows, they never fought in open ground, but from high up in the trees with arrows,
                pitch
                and pitfall traps for anyone who they deemed to be too near their sacred woods. They treated and
                allied
                with no one, and little was truly known about them bar the fact that they lived in great houses
                built
                high up into the massive trees that they revered. There was one rare book called 'The Study of
                Variasa:
                Shining Light on the Dark Blades' that was said to be the most definitive account of the order,
                illuminating some aspects their culture and practices, and speculating on their motives and origins.
                Thaddius was privileged enough to own a copy in his library, but Fiona had not yet gotten a chance
                to
                make it through the massive tome, and she regretted that now.
                "Father is fine though." Edwin said, clearly sensing her worry. "They'll be home before evenfall,
                I'm
                certain." He smiled wryly before continuing; "Alexander is coming too, he joined father in the
                north,
                and he's coming back here with him."
                A gasp escaped her; she had not known that. "Really?"
                "I wonder who you're more excited to see sis, I'm sure you'll be thrilled to have another shot with
                Alexander."
                "Shut up" I will not!" Her face flushed.
                "Your cheeks betray you." He said with a laugh.
                Alexander was a childhood friend of the von Ornstein siblings since he'd been their father's ward
                for
                seven years, a favour won from some trade deal with the Maherday Empire to the north. He was of an
                age
                with Edwin, and the two had been inseparable. He was half-Saerennian, half-Maherdaysian, a somewhat
                unusual combination in the upper class. Fiona had long fawned over Alexander when he was in Pinnetia
                with them, but her feelings and affections had always gone unrequited. She hadn't seen him in three
                years now, same as Edwin. Alex was a general in the Maherday army, the second youngest in their
                history
                to ever achieve the rank, he was a man truly, with 21 years. Fiona hadn't thought of him in a while,
                but
                the mere mention of him had put butterflies in her tummy.
                "Why is Alexander coming here?" She finally asked.
                "He was on some diplomatic missive from the Maherday Empire, so he was coming to see father anyway,
                and
                joined them at the siege, it being much closer than the capital." Fiona could hear the envy in her
                brother's voice.
                "Where's mother Edwin?" She asked, eager to change the subject from Alexander.
                "Our dear mother is upstairs, putting the finishing touches on some plans for the feast we'll have
                tonight. Alestair has released Casper as you know, and his coming needs a feast to show our love and
                unwavering support."
                "Oh." She hadn't known that either. "But I don't understand Eddie, they still haven't held a
                council,
                why is everyone coming back here first, only to ride all the way back to Fantora to sort out a
                treaty?"
                Edwin's face hardened, "Something must needs doing first."
                "What?"
                "I can't say."
                "Why the hell not? Is this because I haven't been reading those reports and just asking you for
                information? Come on Eddie, stop messing around, this is important."
                "No, it's not that." He said. "You won't find this info in reports anyway."
                He gave her a hard look but refused to say anymore.
                "Ugh you're infuriating!" She said pushing her chair out angrily, frustrated with her brother's
                coyness
                and walked quickly, pouting, out the front door to get some fresh air.
                "Love you too." Her brother called after her sardonically.

                **************

                The cool spring her air hit her refreshingly after she made her way out of the dining room and into
                the
                main courtyard. Guards and workers all around her bowed or inclined their heads at her passing, she
                knew
                many of them by name: Rupert, the handsome stableboy with floppy hair and his stern, balding father
                Pietro, one of their senior gardeners, a stout old lady called Marge whose clothes always had a
                green
                tinge to them even on her days off, the deputy master-of-arms, Morne, who had the nickname Keg, due
                to
                his shape and size. Fiona knew them all better than anyone else in the Royal Tower, bar Thaddius.
                "A good king knows his people" he had always told her, "Kingship is not free reign, but a
                give-and-take,
                a contract of sorts with those under your command." She had been taking those words to heart a lot
                more
                as of late, reciprocating their hard work at the Royal Palace as much as she was able.
                The palace grounds sat high upon a plateau at the top of a hill named Gwynn's Canvas for her great
                ancestor Gwynn, The Pale King, who was said to have built and designed the city with white-stoned
                towers
                and tall buildings that peeked out over huge grey walls at the city below. All of the original
                buildings
                in the palace grounds had been built of the same beautiful white stone, and flags and banners of
                green,
                white and blue hung from many towers and windows, the colours of the von Ornstein household. The
                palace
                was a large rectangular land mass, divided into two equal parts, the first was a cobble-stoned,
                sprawling mass of buildings; including a library, an armoury, stables, storerooms, guest towers, the
                Grand Theatre, The Tower of Light where the majority of the Royal Guard stayed and of course, the
                largest and most impressive structure, The Royal Tower of Pinnetia. Just east of the Royal Tower was
                the
                dividing wall, itself a miles-long mosaic depicting history and folklore from even before Gwynn's
                time,
                some of it long forgotten, half-remembered only through fading impressions on the dividing wall. The
                other half of the palace grounds was the Great Garden of Aladeen. It had originally been farmland,
                mills
                and markets used to sustain those living on the other side and as a trading hub for the surrounding
                area, but Gwynn had changed it in his brother's honour after he was killed in war. Aladeen had
                reportedly loved nature, so Gwynn had decided that nature should be his honour and legacy. He tore
                down
                all the buildings on one half of the palace grounds and declared that only nature would prosper on
                this
                side of the palace grounds. That had been over 700 years ago, but the great garden still stood in
                Aladeen's honour and was revered as a precious wonder of the world. Botanists and nature enthusiasts
                came from all over to work or just visit the gardens, but only a select few were allowed to enter.
                Fiona strolled across the courtyard and stopped to chat to whomever looked like they had some spare
                time
                to talk, people were busy now that spring had come, there was much work to be done and Fiona did not
                want to interrupt people just because she was a princess. She decided to walk west towards the main
                gate. She waved over at some guards stationed at the door of The Tower of Light, which was an
                impressive, even though it was dwarfed by the Royal Tower just next to it. As she got further away
                from
                the tower, the signature white stone of the buildings gave way to newer, smaller buildings made of
                wood
                or granite, these had not been built by Gwynn, but later residents who had needed residence when
                working
                on various jobs through the palace grounds, some of these buildings had been painted white to mirror
                the
                white stone the Gwynn had used, but an attentive eye would spot the difference very quickly. Allan
                had
                told her that the palace grounds had become like a town within a town, with many trying to migrate
                into
                the palace to make their fortune amongst the nobility and royalty of Pinnetia. Fiona got to the
                front
                gate of the palace grounds before realising that she had skipped breakfast when she walked out on
                Edwin,
                and decided to cut her walk short and go back to the Royal Tower, it was a big day ahead.
                "Back so soon?" Edwin jibed when she re-entered the large dining hall.
                She ignored the jib and asked one of the serving girls if they could bring her some food in her
                quarters
                before making her way back upstairs. She was still angry at Edwin for not telling her why everyone
                was
                coming back to Pinnetia before properly handling the Fantoran situation.
                She lay down on her bed in a bit of a huff while she waited for breakfast. She was frustrated at
                Edwin
                for being so taciturn, she didn't know why he wouldn't tell her what was going on. But she felt
                guilty
                with herself too. When she had heard that the siege was being suspended so quickly, she was
                delighted,
                and thought it apt to put the whole affair behind her as soon the rest of the nation would. She'd
                gone
                heavy on cello and fencing practice, making steel sing as well as string. I should have been reading
                reports with Edwin, she thought. Maybe then he would have thought me mature enough to handle
                whatever
                news he was hiding from me... Her brooding was interrupted by a knock on her door.
                "I beg your pardon, may I enter?"
                "Of course, Allan."
                Allan was the head butler of the tower, and was as trusted an advisor and friend to Thaddius as some
                of
                the most esteemed commanders and vassals. He was a short man, but lean and strong, you wouldn't know
                his
                arms were toned and firm due to his long black butlers' coat. He was getting into his late 50's and
                his
                hair had stopped growing on the top of his head, only on the sides now. That and his stern demeanour
                always made him appear a little older than he was.
                "You shouldn't skip breakfast, little princess." He said, entering with the food that she had asked
                be
                brought up.
                "I know." She sighed, now ashamed at herself for making someone bring her food on top of everything
                else. "Edwin really upset me earlier. I hate how he thinks I'm such an airhead, I'm just as smart as
                he
                is but he only sees me as a silly little girl now that he's trying to impersonate father so much."
                "Of course he doesn't dear, you are still young, so is he. You mustn't let things like that get you
                down
                so."
                He laid the food down on the end table next to her bed and sat down next to her. Prince is Edwin is
                young too, child. He's still only learning to be a prince, and it is no easy thing to run a kingdom.
                We
                have the terrifying and hungry Maherday Empire to the north, ever expanding and probing for
                weakness, a
                veritable warzone west of them in the Disputed Lands, God knows who'll Roknia by years end, and now
                an
                unruly vassal very close to both. That's not even mentioning the perilous, or all the other work
                that
                needs doing to appease and maintain all the other vassals in the nation, even the loyal ones. They
                all
                look to your father for protection, conciliation, mediation. His is the direction fingers will point
                if
                things go wrong. This is the cost of rule princess, your father's aptitude at these things are why
                they
                accept his judgement, pay taxation and ride forth to war with him when called upon. One day, that
                aptitude must come from Edwin, a daunting notion, no doubt."
                "I know that, I do. But Edwin seems like he's losing himself these days, he's so obsessed with being
                like father and staying ahead of all the political machinations going on that he's become colder...
                Harder... He's not as kind as he was before, he doesn't smile as much" She finished sadly.
                Allan smiled sadly at her. He had a face that could bestow a very paternal smile, but not a
                necessarily
                attractive one. He had a wide nose that was very flat, big black bushy eyebrows and puffy cheeks
                taht
                seemed a little at odds with the rest of his person, as he was quite lean and lithe.
                "It is not easy to make the kind of hard choices that a ruler must make, responsibility can harden a
                person. One must make sacrifices if one hopes to be a successful ruler."
                "And what about being good to your people?" She threw back. "How can you be good and kind to the
                people
                who depend on you if you lose your heart just to get ahead politically. Resolve and kindness are not
                mutually exclusive. The best leaders should have both."
                Allan pondered that moment. "Hmm, certainly that would be the ideal, but it is a very rare and great
                ruler who can maintain a kind heart and survive in such a vicious political landscape."
                "Is that not what Saerennia deserves?"
                "It is not always about what people deserve, but what those in power can realistically accomplish."
                That felt like something of a cop-out to Fiona, but she didn't want to belabour the point, so she
                simply
                sat up and started working on the breakfast that Allan had delivered to her.
                "Thanks for bringing me breakfast Allan."
                "Not at all, dear."
                All must have sensed that she still had some unease in her, as after a while he asked "Are you
                worried
                about 'Edwin's ability to rule?"
                "Hmm" She said in between mouthfuls. "I'm more worried about Edwin."
                "I see." Well give him some time, he has good people around but also a lot of people depending on
                him
                more and more as he takes up more princely responsibility. He misses your father too, you know. "
                "I know." She said, she paused eating her breakfast for a moment as something Allan had said before
                popped into her head. "What you were saying about the Maherday Empire, it almost seems like you
                think a
                war is coming between us, but we've had friendly relations for some time now. Alexander is even
                coming
                over on a diplomatic missive to see father."
                Allan's face hardened a little. "The Maherday are dangerous, little princess, do not underestimate
                them.
                Before you were born, they were threatening all the regions around them, even as far south as us,
                I'm
                sure you know they attacked Aresa's province, Arakumo before your mother and father married. They
                held
                Roknia back then too, and were smashing the Derischord Alliance then too. The only thing that
                stopped
                them was themselves."
                "The fourth Maherday civil war." Fiona remembered from her history lessons.
                "Aye." Said Allan. "The Bastard War they called it. The other Maherday civil wars were all hundreds
                of
                years ago. The one you that you've probably learned about was the first since the Mata Dynasty took
                control of the empire. Do you remember what happened?"
                Fiona thought back to her lessons. "I think so. Jardinho Mata slew his father Eins and sparked the
                war,
                his brother Watro rose up against him but Jardinho triumphed, and Watro was slain."
                Allan nodded. "So it goes. But things were a little more complicated than that. Jardinho wasn't
                Eins'
                natural son, but his adoptive son. Apparently, Eins legitimised Jardinho because he coveted his
                power,
                Jardinho was a prodigy at weaving, a polymath supposedly. So Eins took him in and trained him to
                strengthen the family and pit him against Watro to make him stronger. His blood is not pure
                Maherdaysian, but half."
                "That's why they called it The Bastard War?"
                "Aye. The Maherday have always been obsessed with the purity of blood, many resented Eins even
                adopting
                someone into his family that wasn't pure blooded. And to see someone like that rise to the position
                of
                emperor... Honestly, it's astonishing. That was all well over twenty years ago now, and despite his
                'bastard blood' Jardinho has consolidated power to the point now where his rule is secure. If he
                turns
                that incredible potential and ambition towards us..." Allan didn't need to finish that particular
                point.
                It sent Fiona into a pensive mood.
                "Don't worry, princess." He said after noting her somber silence. "Jardinho is strong but we are
                too,
                Thaddius is a great king, and there's no reason he won't be able to maintain the détente we share
                right
                now."
                Fiona smiled. "Thanks, Allan. I'll be sure to go a little easier on Edwin, I know he's under a lot
                of
                stress."

                ******************

                Allan had left Fiona with a lot to reflect on, and before she knew it, it was already time to
                prepare
                for the feast. She dressed as well as she knew how to for the feast, choosing a full-length, low-cut
                sapphire blue gown with a gold trim and small diamonds dotted all around the bodice, like stars in
                the
                night sky. The dress was heavy and crinolined, so no one was likely to see her feet, but she wore
                her
                best high-heeled shoes anyway, along with her finest hairnet; a piece of many coloured gems: ruby,
                emerald, amber, topaz, turquoise to name but a few. It was not normally her taste to look quite so
                extravagant, but she had resolved to play the play the part of princess even better since her talk
                with
                Allan, and so she needed to look it too.
                She regretted her choice of shoe almost immediately as it made climbing down the long flights of
                stairs
                quite a mission, and sliding the long pole in a crinolined dress was absolutely out of the question.
                When she finally made it to the bottom of the flight of stairs and passed through the door leading
                from
                the antechamber to the dining hall, Edwin was the first person she saw, he was talking to Allan a
                little
                bit away from the main dining table. Her brother cocked and eyebrow and let out a whistle when he
                saw
                her enter the hall.
                "I don't think even Alexander will be able to withstand you when you look like that Oni." He said as
                she
                approached.
                "If he should be so lucky." She chided back. " Listen Edwin I'm sorry I was a bit annoying earlier.
                It
                was unbecoming."
                He looked at her for a moment. "No harm done. I regret that I couldn't be more forthcoming."
                "I understand." She said with a smile.
                "You're very amiable this evening, did Allan slip some soothing potion into that breakfast he
                brought up
                to you?"
                "I would never." The butler balked beside him.
                "No, of course not." Edwin continued. "I know you have no need of potions when it comes to pretty
                girls,
                Allan. I'd heard you were a prolific charmer in the days of your youth, that fathers everywhere
                feared
                for their daughter's maidenheads when you were near."
                Fiona tried to conceal her giggles as the butler's cheeks reddened, but Edwin was spurred on her
                reaction.
                "In fact, I've heard the reason your nose is so flat is because it spent so long pressed up against
                those of sultry maidens returning your kisses."
                "Perhaps that is why yours is so pointed, My Prince?" Allan chided back politely and patiently.
                It was Edwin's to redden in the face, but he laughed as well as Fiona at the jest.
                "You prove my tale with your wit, sharp-tongue." Edwin threw back with a laugh.
                It was so good to see her brother laugh again. he'd been so serious and tired lately. Perhaps he's
                even
                more eager for father to return that I am, with all the stress he's under... Thought Fiona.
                Their mirth was interrupted by the queen. An aura of elegance and decorum accompanied Aresa, the
                Queen
                of Saerennia, as she entered the dining hall from the antechamber that connected it to the central
                stairwell. She strode towards the dais where the others were, draped in a snow-white flowing ball
                gown,
                she had also donned a large and extravagant platinum neckpiece, wide and adorned with an array of
                diamonds at each collarbone that curled towards each other and ended with a single pearl just above
                her
                bosom. The pale ensemble really set off the dark tawny skin tone, dark hair that fell in ringlets to
                the
                small of her back and bright. blood-red coloured eyes. Her face was smooth and handsome, (without a
                wrinkle to be found despite her having nearly 45 years,) with a small button nose just like Fiona's.
                "Your Majesty." Allan greeted her with formally, bowing. Fiona ran over to her mother and pecked her
                on
                either cheek. "You look lovely, mother."
                "As do you sweetheart." She said, smiling back.
                "Mother." Edwin said coolly. Fiona wondered if they'd had a fight earlier that warranted Edwin's
                distant
                tone. Aresa kept her smile on, but Fiona could see the hurt in her eyes.
                "My dear little Eddie," Aresa said sadly. "are you already too old and fierce to greet your dear
                mother
                with a kiss?"
                A brief and tense pause lingered before Edwin finally tore himself away from his intense staring
                contest
                with the floor, and went over to peck his mother on both cheeks. "Of course not." He said, but his
                tone
                remained curt and formal.
                Aresa looked at him for a moment before going straight back into preparing for the feast, she took
                these
                kinfs of things quite seriously and it was difficult for even Thaddius to stop or interrupt when she
                was
                truly in the swing of things.
                "Now before you sit back down dears, we'll need to move that table upon the dais for the feast this
                evening. I do wish your father hadn't battered the old one to pieces in fury. Mahogany is so much
                more
                pleasant than balsam. " Aresa lamented, snapping her fingers brusquely and ordering some servants to
                lift the decorative table to the large, raised indent in the wall where the dais was. She was
                leisurely
                commanding servants this way and that, moving tables in preparation for the feast, when Fiona
                chanced a
                look at Edwin.
                He was wearing a dark green velvet doublet and black breeches, and had stood stone-face since their
                mother's entrance. He was ahead taller than Fiona. Not quite handsome, but very regal. She thought,
                though this impression of regality was offset by the fact that the prince still had bags under his
                eyes
                from last night's lack of sleep. Fiona hoped he cheered up soon, and wrapped her arm tightly around
                his
                as they stood side-by-side, watching Queen Aresa and Allan orchestrate the movements of the tables
                and
                furniture around the dining hall. Aresa eventually had to shoe the two siblings to the side of the
                room
                where they would be out of the way of the rearrangement for the feast. Edwin heaved a great sigh as
                the
                two leaned against a wall, still arm-in-arm. Fiona rested what she hoped might be a comforting head
                against Edwin's shoulder.
                She broke the silence as something struck her as being a little off. "Edwin, evening has nearly
                fallen,
                when are we making our way towards the main gate for the greeting?" She asked, confused.
                "There won't be any greeting at the gate, Oni." He replied warily. "Time is of the essence, we'll be
                greeting them here in the hall instead."
                Fiona found that more than passing strange, she couldn't remember the last time, if ever, they had
                forgone a greeting reception at The Great Gate. "Why?" She asked, looking up at him, puzzled.
                "What's
                going on Edwin?"
                The Prince returned her look worriedly. "Listen, Fiona..." He started quietly, before stopping to
                look
                up at someone approaching them from nearby.
                "The prince and princess, you both look marvellous!" A voice called loudly from nearby. It belonged
                to
                Tailô Bonoleo, a diplomat from Arakumo, the same red-eyed, tawny-skinned province that the queen,
                Aresa
                was from. the royal family had been hosting the Arakuman diplomat for nearly 5 months now. He wore
                his
                spiked black hair quite short, had a sharp jaw, a smooth face, tawny skin and blood-red eyes just
                like
                Aresa and Fiona. The Arakuman province in the east had risen in revolt some 25 years ago, having a
                long
                and bloody history with the many of the other provinces in Saerennia, in particular, the now-capital
                province Pinnetia, where Thaddius hailed from, and where the palace grounds were situated. Aresa's
                hand
                in marriage to Thaddius had been how peace had come about, but as that was coming about, just a day
                before their wedding, the Maherday Empire had struck from the north, with their old Emperor Eins
                Mata
                sensing weakness. Even so many years on, the once proud and powerful nation was a shade of its
                former
                riches and glory. Tailô still looked quite affluent though, Fiona had always thought. Adorned in
                gold
                and silver necklaces, bracelets and broaches. But Fiona knew he was no pampered parasite, merely
                using
                his diplomatic position for his own gain. He dressed finally to make an impression in the Royal
                Tower,
                he was passionate about Arakumo, always fighting for more aid for his people, trying to make sure
                they
                were well-provisioned and not forgotten. After 5 months though, many of the others in the Royal
                Tower
                had long since started to find this behaviour wearisome, Fiona knew. But she had always found it,
                and
                his consistent chivalry, quite admirable.
                "You look splendid yourself Tailô." She returned with a smile.
                "You are too kind princess." He replied bowing with a toothy grin, before giving her hand a gentle
                and
                respectful kiss.
                Edwin did not look at all impressed to see him.
                "What? No kiss for me Tailô?" he asked disparagingly.
                "Edwin!" Fiona shouted, aghast. "Tailô is a guest here! Remember your courtesies!" she finished,
                mortified.
                "No discourtesy done at all fair princess." said Tailô with another smile, as always gracious and
                courteous himself. "I'm sure our good prince was merely jesting."
                Edwin began to retort but a sudden hush fell around the dining hall just then.
                "Pray, excuse me, My Lieges." Tailô said, leaving with them a final bow. Aresa was moving brusquely
                down
                the hall to meet a man who had just entered it. A rider. Fiona knew at once, a scout just ahead of
                their
                father's party. The king was coming. </p>
