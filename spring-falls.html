        </div>

        <div class="project-text-content" id="springFalls">
            <p>Hey! Old man!”</p>
            <p>Ranieth didn’t bother to knock as her entered the study that had been converted into a makeshift lab by
                the wizened Dr. Glacke. The place was a disastrous, cluttered mess of books, parchments and scrolls that
                had an odd musky odour Ranieth was becoming much more comfortable with than he would have liked to
                admit. The room was dominated by a table in it’s centre that looked like it should be collapsing under
                the weight of all the trinkets, gears and glass apparatus it was supporting. But Ranieth could not see
                his old friend anywhere. </p>
            <p>"OLD MAN!!” He shouted louder. “Where’s the salt!? I hope you’re not doing any weird shit with it in
                here, you know how bloody expensive it since-”</p>
            <p>His words were interrupted by a lightning fast prod of fingers straight into his side courtesy of the old
                man. Ranieth recoiled with a pained shout and wheeled around, swinging an elbow outward towards the old
                man, but Dr. Glacke dodged deftly as he expected. Ranieth finally got a good look at the doctor as he
                lifted his head from ducking under Ranieth’s elbow. </p>
            <p>What little light was getting into the study shone upon Dr. Glacke then, revealing a wry, bespectacled
                face, crowned by a wiry head of hair that seemed to defy gravity in every direction, as if permanently
                electrocuted. The old man was wearing his signature grey-green shirt and loose beige pants at least a
                size too long for him, so the ends dragged along the ground when he walked and were heavily frayed from
                the experience.</p>
            <p>“Neither aware enough to dodge nor sharp enough to retaliate!” Dr. Glacke jibed. “And you’re supposed to
                be a fighter around here lad!?” The doctor waited attentively for a response, either physical or verbal.
                Ranieth obliged. Darting out his right arm, fingers outstretched, to repay Dr. Glacke in kind. The
                doctor dodged backwards but the right was merely a distraction, as with his left foot Ranieth had
                stepped on the end of the old man’s loose-hanging pant-leg/ When the doctor dodged, he fell backwards,
                threatening to crash into the precariously stacked table, but Ranieth just managed to grab him by the
                scruff of the neck first, and lifted the old man’s face towards his own, imposing, muscular frame. When
                there was naught but a few inches between the faces of the two men, Ranieth, in a dark, icy tone asked;
            </p>
            <p>“Where’s. The. Salt?”</p>
            <p>Dr. Glacke’s wrinkled face broke into a wide toothy grin around his pointed nose (though he was a missing
                an incisor). He steadied himself as Ranieth gently patted down the shirt he had previously done the
                discourtesy of scrunching up. </p>
            <p>“Ah... the salt.” He chuckled in this deep rasping tone. “Well you see my dear boy, sometimes eh...
                Sometimes the nourishing value of the salt must be sacrificed in the pursuit a nobler goal, a deeper
                truth!” </p>
            <p>Ranieth ran a finger through his own wavy, jet black hair as sharp eyes blue eyes looked Dr. Glacke up
                and down. Ranieth had an attractive face, sharp featured and symmetrical, pale-skinned and statuesque.
            </p>
            <p> “Gods above! You couldn't have been a little gentler with that one, old man!?” Ranieth asked, rubbing
                his side in pain.</p>
            <p>“Ha! What do you know about gods, boy? And more importantly, how many bloody times have I told you to
                knock!?”</p>
            <p>“All right, all right. So I’m making a trip to the market for salt then, anything else we need?”</p>
            <p>“Aye, fuel for the lanterns is all. Our water situation is fine, should hold out until week’s end. Do we
                have a meat and veg for supper?”</p>
            <p>“Eh yeah, we should do.” Ranieth supposed. “Hey, old man, what do you think about all the tales that are
                coming out about things to the east? Explosions and bright lights, talk about people going missing,
                sightings of strange things from the outposts in the east... There’s a lot of talk going around, of
                people and maybe even civilization beyond The Burning Plains, life outside Amara... Do you believe it?”
            </p>
            <p>“Hmph” Doctor Glacke snorted derisively. “What do you think we just sprung out of the ground like some
                redgrass, boy!? The people who founded this place were nomads, Ranieth, travellers! That’s about all we
                do know that isn’t just hearsay from that time. They had to come from somewhere before they settled here
                three of four hundred years ago. The question isn’t whether there’s or not there’s life out there, the
                question is what it’s going to do when it finds us...”</p>
            <p>The somber, rhetorical tone that he trailed off on left them in a pensive silence, which lingered for
                some time before Ranieth interrupted it.</p>
            <p> “But why the east?” he asked. “I always imagined any exploring we did would be across the Endless Sea to
                the west, or traversing the Great ~Northern Deserts. There’s nothing in the east or south only violet
                fire and death for miles and miles, noting grows, and the heat and smoke are unbearable...”</p>
            <p>The old man pondered a moment. “Well of course The Burning Plains are uninhabitable, that’s for a
                certainty. However, that doesn’t mean that they’re impassable, from our side or the other. And it’s our
                own fault we don’t know more, do you know how many bloody times I’ve asked that useless Grand Council of
                ours for further expeditions!? If it wasn’t their stinginess with money it was the fucking church
                claiming that ours is a land of paradise granted by the gods, and that The Bruning Plains are the path
                to the fires of hell, to be tampered with at peril! Such morony!! Imagine it, little Ranny-”</p>
            <p>“Please don’t call me that”</p>
            <p>“A field of violet fire, thousands of miles long, that doesn’t burn out, that point-blank refuses to,
                even with all of our greatest efforts, water inflames it even further and nothing else we’ve tried has
                had any effect other than to stoke the great field of flame. Do you know how much energy is produced
                there in just a single day? How valuable that could be if it was utilized properly? The benefits would
                be astronomical! Yet still, we sit here and do nothing but quarrel with each other about faith and race
                and indulge our own selfishness!”</p>
            <p>Ranieth had heard this speech a dozen times before, and knew better than to interrupt the old man’s
                wrath. He wasn’t really one to interrupt others anyway, he was more of a listener than a speaker in most
                conversations.</p>
            <p>“And those fucking outposts!” The doctor went on “Measly wooden pricks built all around over the place
                with the promise of a town sprouting out around them, or an expedition being led being led from them,
                yet there’s no greater adage to apathy in the whole country!!”</p>
            <p>“Your trousers could give them a run for their money, I reckon.” Ranieth finally put it.
                Dr. Glacke chuckled. “You’ve got me there, boy.”</p>
            <p>“All right doc, I’m off to the market.” Ranieth said, smiling at the doctor.</p>
            <p>“Before you go, please...” Dr. Glacke implored, reaching into one of an absurd amount of pockets and
                compartments he had decorated his ragged baggy pants with, looking for silvers. </p>
            <p>“Keep your silver, I have plenty.”</p>
            <p>”Ranny, come on, hang on to yours, treat yourself, enjoy yourself, don’t be spending it on bloody oil and
                salt.”</p>
            <p>Ranieth was intrigued and a little thrown off by the look the old man was giving him, pleading and almost
                sorrowful.</p>
            <p>“Don’t worry I’ve got plenty. Probably more than you do, you hack.”</p>
            <p>“Please kid...”</p>
            <p>The old man gripped Ranieth’s arm as he moved to leave. The doctor had been Ranieth’s foster father since
                he had found him abandoned as a babe. Dr. Edward Glacke, pushing 70, was still outrageously strong and
                nimble for someone of his age, but Ranieth had felt his strength beginning to wain as he approached the
                twilight of his days, and Ranieth often found himself having to be more gentle when the old man started
                messing around with him or when they did any training together. Though his side ached painfully from the
                doctor’s jab, and the doctor’s posture was still that of a much“ younger man, straight as an arrow,
                Ranieth sometimes thought the old man had a spine of steel, and was constantly berated by the oft
                curmudgeonly old man to ‘straighten up those shoulders! You're crooked as a ram’s horn!’ </p>
            <p>“All right, we’ll split it then.” Ranieth finally relented, taking a few silvers from Dr. Glacke.</p>
            <p>“Watch yourself, Ranny. This outsider situation does really warrant close attention.” Dr. Glacke before
                continuing: “There’s so much I still need to tell you...”</p>
            <p>Ranieth didn’t really know what to say to that so he left the doctor with a nod and a wave as he departed
                the musty study. The hallway that adjoined the study and led to the front door was narrow and cramped
                for space, though largely undecorated. The modest bungalo they lived in was made of the same orange-red
                clay-like brick that most of the other houses and structures in their homeland, Amara, were made from.
                The house had two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen that was little more than a few pots around a make-shift
                fireplace, a cellar underneath for storing salted meat and other perishables and a privy out the back.
                Ranieth walked down their little garden out front, with a few vegetable patches that were starting to
                show signs of life. Spring was among them, beginning only a few months past. They had worn out the most
                of last year's fair harvests but had to buy meat if they wanted the indulgence, as they had no extra
                space for animals.</p>
            <p>The market was a couple of miles walk the house, and was quiet by the time Ranieth made it there as
                evening had been quick in falling. Ranieth made straight for the general wares store, in the middle of
                the market square, which had an armorial wooden sign swinging gently from the eave of it’s wooden roof.
                Ranieth was happy that the market was quiet as he had only really started to get the looks and stares
                that the townspeople gave him, even after all these years. Amara was a small remote country, and their
                town Assirai was even smaller still. It was situated south, in between two of the countries three major
                cities. The town was little more than a glorified village in truth, and it’s people were tight-knight,
                and more than prone to suspicion and superstition, wary to travellers and things outside of the
                ordinary. Even though Ranieth had lived in all his life in the village, he was certainly different. At
                6’3 he poked uncomfortably above the average Amaran and that was really the least of his worries. He had
                a much paler skin tone that the peach-bronze coloured Amari, and his pale blue eyes were quite a rarity
                too, as most of the Amari had a green-brown colour. His reputation had started to precede him as well,
                as he had started to earn money by competing in fighting bouts held in various mountain passes all over
                the country. The legality of these bouts was currently a matter of contention with people from every
                corner of Amara and they had a nefarious reputation at best. </p>
            <p>The one thing that Ranieth really thought set him apart though, was his name; Ranieth Valash. It was a
                passing strange name for the region and had always made him a little uncomfortable in social situations.
                After all, a name was the first thing that you heard about a person, and the incongruity of his
                name had always painted him as something of a stranger right from the outset, despite living in Amara
                for as long as he could remember. Dr. Glacke had not come up with the name himself but had found a note
                with the abandoned babe when he discovered him. ‘Ranieth Valash’ was the only thing written on the note,
                and Dr. Glacke had decided to name as such, though Ranieth often wished he hadn’t. </p>
            <p>As Ranieth entered the shop he was greeted by Beltrice, the kindly middle-aged woman who owned the
                general wares store. She had a warm personality and was almost always smiling, but had a well-earned
                reputation as vicious haggler when challenged. </p>
            <p>“I didn’t expect much more custom this late into the evening, young man, how are you?” she asked,
                smiling.</p>
            <p>“I’m good Bel, you?”</p>
            <p>“Fine dear, fine. How’s that lunatic you live with?</p>
            <p>“He’s lively as ever.”</p>
            <p>Dr. Glacke was near as bad for haggling as Beltrice was, and sparks flew if he went in to buy so much as
                a pinch of salt. </p>
            <p>“Any news, Bel?”</p>
            <p>“Aye, child, always. You know i never fail to keep an ear to the ground, surprises are bad for business!
                Adal Monks, you know him, he’s on the council, is in trouble for getting some woman with child, outside
                of wedlock! And him a widower and all! The church is furious, well one half of it anyway! Poor old man,
                don’t know if he’ll make it through his scandal, now that he’s lost the support of his church. Hmm let’s
                see was there anything else, oh yeah! They lost contact with another outpost to the east if you’d
                believe it though no can say why this time. The churches are disagreeing on this one as well, the Lord’s
                Order sect of the church are convinced that it’s the devil himself, punishing us for our ungodly ways. A
                dark notion...” She finished grimly. “Anyway love, what can I do you for?”</p>
            <p>“Ehm an ounce of salt please, and a litre of oil.”</p>
            <p>She chattered away about happenings of the village as the measured out the salt and oil. Ranieth misliked
                gossip and smalltalk in truth, but he had a lot of time for Beltrice and felt at ease listening to her.
                And little by little he was starting to become more comfortable as he gained confidence from his new
                job. He bid Beltrice adieu, paying her for her wares and made his home. </p>
            <p>Thoughts of what the night would bring weighed heavy on his mind as her walked home with the salt and
                oil. Dr. Glacke had not failed to share his great disapproval and sorrow at Ranieth starting to fight in
                the mountain passes, but Ranieth was a man in full now, with his 21 years, and he was good at fighting
                too. Strong and fast, he was also taller than a lot of the other participants so he had the advantage in
                reach. The fighting was done one on one, hand to hand, no weapons or fire was allowed and there was a
                variety of win conditions depending on the night, but the most standard of them all by far, was
                knock-out. All manner of folk attended the fights hidden in the mountains from the very richest to the
                very poorest in Amari society. Large sums of silver were bet back and forth on various things throughout
                the night: first blood, length of the fight, even what kind of strike the final blow would be were all
                different things spectators and fighters a like could win and lose fortunes on, with fighters being
                allowed to bet only on themselves, with no upper-limit. </p>
            <p>Ranieth was 8-0 undefeated but he was nervous about tonight’s fight, tonight’s fight was different. He
                was going toe-to-toe with a man named Rorsch. If Ranieth stood out at 6’3, Rorsch was like two ro three
                sore thumbs all gruesomely stitched together. He was at least half a foot taller than Ranieth, a pillar
                of a human being, near round as one as well, though it was all muscle. Fights to the death were banned
                in the arenas hidden in the mountain passes so as to avoid even more trouble with the local authorities,
                but Rorsch had killed more than a few of his combatants with his massive, club-like fists, and left
                others in not fir state to fight again. </p>
            <p>Ranieth had started out just watching, dragged along by one of his few friends, Marvin Matteo. His large
                frame was quickly picked up on and it wasn’t long before he was standing over a bloody, unconscious
                mess, arms aloft, blood red hot with the intoxicating fervour of the drums and the crowd and the
                intensity of it all. But afterwards was the come-down. The pains of the bruises you sustained starting
                to set in, the guilt of the dirty silver being pushed into your hands, the realisation that the
                normality of everyday life can never quite compete with that ardent, blazing high and worst of all, the
                dreadful realization that you’ve really, truly hurt another person. The feeling haunted him for some
                time afterwards, but he could never resist going back again and again, even if Rorsch threatened to
                change the shape of his face with a single blow. </p>
            <p>His thoughts were interrupted by the the sight of the front door, within, Dr. Glacke awaited him in their
                little kitchen, bringing some water to the boil for a broth and chopping some stale carrots. </p>
            <p>“Ah, you’re back.”</p>
            <p>“I am.”</p>
            <p>“How’s Bel?”</p>
            <p>“Chatty as ever.” Ranieth informed him, sitting on a small stool across from the doctor. After a few
                minutes of silence Ranieth realised that the doctor was staring at him, disapprovingly at that. </p>
            <p>“You’re quiet this evening.”</p>
            <p>“Sorry.” Ranieth feigned a yawn “Just tired.”</p>
            <p>“Bullshit.” The doctor saw right through him. “You only get this particular flavour of pensive when
                you’re making a trip to the mountain passes. Imagine,” he said warily “all my years of raising you and
                you find work getting punched in the head.”</p>
            <p>“Well, to be fair, not getting punched in the head is kind of the idea.”</p>
            <p>The doctor heaved a great sigh “What happened to your job at the smithy? That’s good honest work you
                know, and no one is bloody at the end of it.”</p>
            <p>“Might be, if you’re smithing a sword.”</p>
            <p>“It was good to see you doing manual labour as well, you really bulked up from that job.” Ranieth
                couldn’t disagree with that, his arms had gotten huge from all the hammering away and heavy lifting at
                the smithy. </p>
            <p>“Honestly, I couldn’t take the boredom of it. It’d be years as well before I’d have been able to start my
                own smithy, and besides Jobe is a rough taskmaster, he’s as bad as you.”</p>
            <p>“Hmph.” Doctor Glacke was not impressed. “Well don’t expect me to heal your cuts and bruises when you get
                back.”</p>
            <p>“I won’t.” But truthfully, that was a bluff, he might well have great need of the doctor if Rorsch had
                his way. Though he was no true doctor really, more of a scientist and a maverick that had taken on the
                moniker of doctor for convenience sake. His discoveries and experiments often ended up drawing the ire
                of the church, who damned them as wizardry or devilry. “What would you know about honest work anyway,
                old-timer!? Locked in that study of yours doing god-knows-what, misappropriating the bloody salt at
                every opportunity!” Ranieth continued.</p>
            <p>The jibe finally brought a smile and a chuckle to the doctor’s face. “Too much salt’ll kill ya, boy.
                Excitement too, you bloody addict.” Ranieth smiled, it was always nice to avoid a bollocking where his
                new found source of income was concerned. </p>
            <p>“Fire’s gone out, Doc.”</p>
            <p>“What?” Dr. Glacke tutted and lifted his hand towards the peat beneath the pot, and from his open palm,
                shot forth a burst of flame to light it. </p>
