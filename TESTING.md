### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the site and find out more about the creator. For example, age, nationality,
       professional & personal interests.
        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath 
        there is a Hero Image of the creator. 
        2. Peeking out underneath are two clearly labelled sections: 'Who am I?' and 'About Me'. These are very typical sections for a personal website and
        immediately inform the user as to it's purpose while also providing extra information about the creator.
        3. Upon scrolling down to explore the home page content, a 'Currently' section will also become visible. This section has an array of images and progress 
        bars that inform prospective employers of the creator's progress through full-stack web development at a glance.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easliy navigate through the site, and have a clear understanding of what the purpose of each page is and where
       it's most pertinnent information is. 
       1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, with each link describing what the 
        page they will end up at is very clearly.
       2. The navigation bar sticks to the top of the page regardless of how far down the user scrolls. This way, the user always all of the available content on the website 
        available to them within two or three clicks.
       3. The sticky navigation bar also ensures that the user never feel trapped, even on mobile where the navigation bar folds into a hamburger menu that most users, 
        especially prospective web design employers should be very familiar with using. 
       4. The navigation bar also has a very thick text underline on all resolutions so the user can instantly discern what page they are currently viewing. 

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to check the employment status and professionalism of the creator, I also want to locate their social media links to see 
       their followings on social media and determine how trustworthy and legitimate they are.
       1. Once the new visitor has read the 'Who am I?' and 'about Me' sections they will notice the 'Currently' section, which right now includes the creator's progress 
        through web design but will also be updated to reflect the employment status of the creator.
       2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
       3. Also lcoated in the footer at the bottom of every page on the site is a download link to the creator's CV so that the user can easliy check what the creator is
       currently up to and what they have been up to. 

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals  
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to paint a picture of the creator's work history.
        1. A download link to the creator's CV is available at the bottom of every page in the footer.
        2. Next to the 'Home' tab in the sticky navigation bar menu is a 'Work History' tab. Clicking on this link will take the user to an intereactive resume of sorts, here 
        the user will clearly be able to see a timeline of the creator's work experience, complete with clickable logos for every instance of employment. If the user chooses they
        can click the logo to be taken to an external link in a new tab and find out more about the aforementioned company.
        3. On the 'Get in Touch' page of the website there is a very clearly indicated section for prospective employers with a large 'Click here to get started' button. When clicked
        this will open up a modal box, where the user can choose between typing in their name and email address to be emailed a copy of the creatros' CV or click a button to download 
        it then and there. Either option will close the modal box so the user can go back to exploring the website. 
        
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to take a look at the projects that the creator has worked on in the past and compare them to my current ambitions for my own projects.
        1. Next to the 'Work History' tab in the sticky navigation menu is a 'Projects' tab, that when clicked will take the user to an interactive page that shows both the programming
        projects that the creator has been involved with and the writing projects that the creator has produced.
        2. Both the programming and writing sections of the 'Projects' page are clearly divided and segmented, so that the user can easily tell if the information being read pertains to
        programming or to literature. While these two area obviously do overlap, they are very different and so a clear divide is required.
        3. Another clear disvision of the two types of projects available is the style of images used to indicate each project. The programming projects are all screenshots of the websites
        mentioned, whereas the litereature/writing projects all have more abstract and artistic representations, indiciating a change in content.
        4. Clicking on any of the large images on the programming section of the 'Projects' page will bring the user to an external link in a new tab where they can explore one of the three
        projects currently available.
        5. Clicking on any of the large images on the writing section of the 'Projects' page will bring the user to an internal link where they can read one of the three available projects.
        in order to not entrap the user after getting to the end of a litereature project, there are links to the other two litereature projects available on the bottom of every writing project
        page.
