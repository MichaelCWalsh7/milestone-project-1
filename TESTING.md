### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the site and find out more about the creator. For example, age, nationality,
       professional & personal interests.
        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath 
        there is a Hero Image of the creator. 
        2. Peeking out underneath are two clearly labelled sections: 'Who am I?' and 'About Me'. These are very typical sections for a personal website and
        immediately inform the user as to its purpose, while also providing extra information about the creator.
        3. Upon scrolling down to explore the home page content, a 'Currently' section will also become visible. This section has an array of images and progress 
        bars that inform prospective employers of the creator's progress through full-stack web development at a glance.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site, and have a clear understanding of what the purpose of each page is and where
       it's most pertinent information is. 
       1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, with each link describing what the 
        page they will end up at is very clearly.
       2. The navigation bar sticks to the top of the page regardless of how far down the user scrolls. This way, the user can always see and access all of the content on 
       the website that is available to them, in just two or three clicks.
       3. The sticky navigation bar also ensures that the user never feels trapped, even on mobile where the navigation bar folds into a hamburger menu that most users, 
        especially prospective web design employers should be very familiar with using. 
       4. The navigation bar also has multicoloured visual background effects on the active page, so the user can instantly discern what page they are currently viewing. 

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to check the employment status and professionalism of the creator, I also want to locate their social media links to see 
       their followings on social media and determine how trustworthy and legitimate they are.
       1. Once the new visitor has read the 'Who am I?' and 'about Me' sections they will notice the 'Currently' section, which right now includes the creator's progress 
        through web design but will also be updated to reflect the employment status of the creator.
       2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
       3. Also located in the footer, at the bottom of every page of the site, is a download link to the creator's CV, so that the user can easily check what the creator is
    currently up to and what they have been up to. 

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals  
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to paint a picture of the creator's work history.
        1. A download link to the creator's CV is available at the bottom of every page in the footer.
        2. Next to the 'Home' tab in the sticky navigation bar menu is a 'Work History' tab. Clicking on this link will take the user to an interactive resume of sorts. Here, 
        the user will clearly be able to see a timeline of the creator's work experience, complete with clickable logos for every instance of employment. If the user chooses they
        can click the logo to be taken to an external link in a new tab and find out more about the aforementioned company.
        3. On the 'Get in Touch' page of the website there is a very clearly indicated section for prospective employers with a large 'Click here to get started' button. When clicked
        this will open up a modal box, where the user can choose between typing in their name and email address to be emailed a copy of the creator's CV or click a button to download 
        it then and there. Either option will close the modal box so the user can go back to exploring the website. 
        
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to take a look at the projects that the creator has worked on in the past and compare them to my current ambitions for my own projects.
        1. Next to the 'Work History' tab in the sticky navigation menu is a 'Projects' tab, that when clicked will take the user to an interactive page that shows both the programming
        projects that the creator has been involved with and the writing projects that the creator has produced.
        2. Both the programming and writing sections of the 'Projects' page are clearly divided and segmented, so that the user can easily tell if the information being read pertains to
        programming or to literature. While these two area obviously do overlap, they are very different and so a clear divide is required.
        3. Another clear division of the two types of projects available is the style of images used to indicate each project. The programming projects are all screenshots of the websites
        mentioned, whereas the literature/writing projects all have more abstract and artistic representations, indicating a change in content.
        4. Clicking on any of the large images on the programming section of the 'Projects' page will bring the user to an external link in a new tab where they can explore one of the three
        projects currently available.
        5. Clicking on any of the large images on the writing section of the 'Projects' page will bring the user to an internal link where they can read one of the three available projects.
        in order to not entrap the user after getting to the end of a these projects, there are links to the other two literary projects available on the bottom of each.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the user with any questions or queries that I may have with the information provided. 
        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the 'Get in Touch' section.
        2. The 'Get in Touch' section has various ways to contact the creator, for example sending a message in the text area for fellow programmers who want to get in touch, or by beginning an
        email correspondence for prospective employers who wish to get in touch. 
        3. The footer at the bottom of every page, contains various links to the creator's Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn etc.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be opened in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

    4. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to download or be emailed a copy of the creator's CV so that I may add a more traditional copy to my records.
        1. The footer at the bottom of every page contains a link to a PDF of the creator's CV.
        2. When clicking this link the user can choose to simply view, or download the document.
        3. The 'Get in Touch' section also has a clearly marked button for employers that gives the user two choices, they can either input their name and email address to be emailed a copy of the 
        creator's CV, or they can click the button below to open/download the PDF.

    5. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to quickly and easily see where the creators skills and abilities lie within the field of web design find out what kind of programming 
       languages and frameworks they have experience with.  
        1. The 'Currently' section on the home page informs the user with helpful graphs and images what languages the creator is comfortable with.
        2. The 'Projects' section of the site has various links to projects that the creator has made, but also descriptions of the design process and purpose of the website, which offers further 
        insight into the creator's abilities.
        3. The 'Projects' section also contains a link to this website, indicating to users that the very project they are currently accessing was built by the creator, though that information
        should be axiomatic to most users.
    
-   #### Frequent User Goals
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to easily check to see if there are any newly added projects.
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the 'Projects' button from anywhere on the website due to the sticky navigation bar.
    
    2. As a Frequent User, I want to easily check to see if there are any newly added postings to the Work History section or any other important updates to the creator's employment status.
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the 'Work History' button from anywhere on the website due to the sticky navigation bar.
        2. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check the 'Currently' section on the home page for continuous updates on the creator's progress.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or creator.
        1. In the 'Get in Touch' section of the website there is an area dedicated to promoting the creator's newsletter that frequent users of the website should be comfortable with.
        2. The section is punctuated by a large red button saying 'Click here to sign up!!' that when clicked, will open a modal box for the user to type in their and email address to 
        sign up to the newsletter.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop (on various screen sizes), Laptop, iPad & other various types of tablets, iPhones 5, 6, 7 & X as well as other mobile phone types 
    including, but not limited to, Redmi, Huawei, Samsung and Sony.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.


### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image gets pushed down below the navigation bar.
    - A white gap can be seen before scrolling the further down to see the content peaking out.



### Issues Along The Way

- **Footer Displacement**
  1. [Click here to see an image of the issue.](https://michaelcwalsh7.github.io/milestone-project-1/assets/images/README-images/TESTING-images/footer-displacement.png)
  2. The first two things that I began to code were the header and footer of the website, so i could copy the html and use it as a template for the other pages.
  3. However, without any content on the pages the footer would hug the top of the screen, and if there wasn't enough content on the page, then there would be a white space between the footer
  and the bottom of the page, which looked quite unprofessional. 
  4. I didn't want to include a sticky footer, as I had already included a sticky navigation bar in the header, and having both stick to the screen at the same time would take up valuable screen
  space and would distract from the actual content of each page. 
  5. In order to solve this problem I searched online for how i might go about doing this and decided to use some fairly simple code at the beginning of the css stlye page that utilises the grid
  system in order to stick the footer to the bottom of the page without sticking it to the bottom of the viewport permanently. The code that I used was taken from 
  [css tricks and can be found here.](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/)

- **Footer Nametag Issues**
  1. [Click here to see an image of the issue.](https://michaelcwalsh7.github.io/milestone-project-1/assets/images/README-images/TESTING-images/footer-nametag-error.png)
  2. Early in the development cycle, I had included a line of css that set the height of the footer to 100% of the container it was nested in.
  3. However, this caused an issue where the footer would not quite reach the bottom of the screen but would instead leave a very slim white line of just a few pixels benath it.
  4. I then tried to fix this by setting the height of the footer nametag (something that was scrapped for the copyright element now present) to 102% which made it peak out below the 'Download my cv 
  here!!' section as shown in the linked image above.
  5. Changing the height of other elements of the footer to follow suit with this change broke it completely.
  6. After taking a break and adopting a "back to square 1" mentality, I deleted the initial declaration of the height: 100%; property of the whole footer. At that point realising, that it was this 
  line of code that had been causing the problems the whole time. 

- **Grid System Issue**
  1. [Click here to see an image of the issue.](https://michaelcwalsh7.github.io/milestone-project-1/assets/images/README-images/TESTING-images/grid-system-issue.png)
  2. As a result of employing the grid system to ensure a sticky footer as mentioned above, instead of content being added from top to bottom, it was added from bottom to top, as shown in the image 
  above.
  3. I must admit, why exactly this occurred, is somewhat beyond me. I'm not super familiar with the grid system, and didn't have the time to look into it in great detail unfortunately.
  4. By and large it wasn't an issue, as most of the pages had enough content to cover more than 100% of the viewport height, which would push the content just under the navigation bar, as expected.
  Especially on mobile and tablet where the viewports are much smaller.
  5. On larger screens however, at higher resolutions there would be a very large gap between the navigation bar and the beginning of the content, and so extra margin-bottom declarations had to be
  implemented at higher media queries to account for this. 
  6. Eventually though, each individual page picked up so much content that the margin-bottom declarations ended up not being necessary.

- **Newsletter List Issues**
  1. [Click here to see an image of the issue.](https://michaelcwalsh7.github.io/milestone-project-1/assets/images/README-images/TESTING-images/newsletter-list-issues.png)
  2. This one gave me a real headache. No matter what I tried or how many various types of containers I implemented, I couldn't find a way to bring the bullet points for the list next to the actual 
  list items, while still keeping the list text centered in a sensible way.
  3. The fix that i went with in the end was getting some right facing chevrons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and using them as bulletpoints instead of styling a list with css.
  4. It is admittedly not the most elegant of fixes, but including the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons did give me more freedom to style and colour them as I liked.

-   **Default Zoom Issues**
    1. [Click here to see an image of the issue.](https://michaelcwalsh7.github.io/milestone-project-1/assets/images/README-images/TESTING-images/default-zoom-issue.png)
    2. On Chrome for Android & Desktop, the default zoom of some of the web pages will change from 100% to much larger, which will initiate a horizontal scroll bar and not fit the website 
    content to the browser viewport.
    3. This initially was a complete mystery, but after some research I eventually found out that experimentally, Chrome is rolling out a feature that changes the default zoom for an individual 
    web page to help make it more legible on different screens.
    4. Why this website in particular was subject to this process remains a mystery, though I suspect it's due to the large resolution of some of the images used. Although all images used are 
    still scaled to be appropriately viewable at all resolutions
    5. The two fixes that I've implemented for this are setting the max-width of the body and html to 100% of the viewport width and then also setting the default zoom of the body and html to be
    100% so the browser shouldn't zoom in an inappropriate amount. 
    6. The above fix eliminated the issue in testing. The inconsistent nature of this bug only appearing somewhat infrequently, has made more extensive testing somewhat awkward. However all users 
    that reported encountering the bug have now claimed it is resolved.
